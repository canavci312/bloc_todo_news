# REST API Calling and CRUD with Firebase & Bloc

- Strings were left without proper localization and proper Theming wasnt done due to time constraints.
- Views are simple, just for demonstration purposes
- Core folder represents the classes that can be reused in any other app
- Error handling is for demonstration purposes error states may not be produceable. Used dartz and freezed for error handling
- Would have created featureName.dart file to export libraries inside the feature for cleaner code. Example shown in core library
